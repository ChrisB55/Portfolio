## Christopher W. Brown's Web Development Portfolio

This website represents a collection of my Front End web development projects and 
a few examples of professional communications projects Iâ€™ve written over the years. 
I update this webpage around once a month with new projects and sometimes web design changes. 

I utilized the flexbox framework to achieve full responsiveness for any screen size. You can view the portfolio here: https://chrisb55.github.io/Portfolio-Project/
